# PowerAI Vision Datasets

This repository contains a collection of demo datasets intended for use with IBM PowerAI Vision. The directories are in .zip format to make importing them to PowerAI Vision super easy!

Feel free to contribute and add your own datasets - but please keep them as .zip files to reduce the size of this repo, and make sure you update this readme with any relevant links!

If you'd like to know more about getting started with AI Vision or PowerAI in general - check out these links:

## Cloud Access

It is easy (and free) to get a running instance of AI Vision on the SuperVessel service. You can sign up and start using this immediately [here](https://ny1.ptopenlab.com/AIVision/index.html).
There are some limitations to this service, so it is advised to use it only for simple demos and test workloads, and not for any production use cases. For instance, there are limits on the amount of data that you can work with, and many of the APIs generated will be time limited.
